# PeaBrained Education

Welcome to PeaBrained Education!

Our mission is to foster an inclusive and supportive community for those who are interested and are currently learning programming. We believe in the accessibility of knowledge and aim to offer resources and support for all, from ideas to experience to tutoring and teaching. The end goal is to create an environment where anyone can ask questions, share their ideas and code, learn, and grow.


## The Rules

### 1. Don't Be a Jerk
- Be mature and understanding.
- Please be aware of NSFL/NSFW content.
- Be careful of political, religious, or controversial conversation.
- Avoid passive aggression.
- Hate speech is strictly prohibited.
- Malicious attacks are not tolerated.
  - If a joke is problematic, feel free to explain and discuss the issue.
  - This applies to staff as well. If we cross a line, let us know.
- Gatekeeping is not allowed; this is the whole reason this server exists.
- Discouraging someone from learning outright is prohibited.

### 2. Do Not Share Proprietary Information
- Do not share code belonging to a company.
- Do not share documentation belonging to a company.

### 3. Respect Everyone's Time
- Mentors and learners alike should respect each other's time, and communication is key.
- Ping roles are good for letting others know when you need help, but please do not ping roles unnecessarily.
  - If you are talking to a specific person, ping them directly.
- We will not help you finish something on a time crunch. If you have homework, ask early.

### 4. Respect the Field
- "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses." ~ Bjarne Soustrup (Developer of C++)
- Be open and willing to learn.
- ChatGPT and AI tools are just tools. Writing effective, maintainable, and purposeful code still falls on your hands.

### 5. Homework Help
- "We are not Chegg. We are not CourseHero. If you need help understanding a topic for your homework, we're happy to explain the topic. If you need help doing your homework, we are not paid enough to do so." ~ A Dumb Door
- "I wish not to cheat, I wish not to have my homework done for me." ~ Triasmatic (In Old Man Voice)
- Follow your school's academic integrity rules.
